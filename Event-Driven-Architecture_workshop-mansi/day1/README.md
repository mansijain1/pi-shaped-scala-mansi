1. What is an event in Event-Driven Architecture? (with real-world example)

In Event-Driven Architecture (EDA), an event is a notification that something significant has happened in the system â€” a change in state.
Real-world example: Imagine you're waiting for a pizza delivery. When the pizza arrives, the delivery person rings the doorbell. The doorbell ringing is an event â€” it informs you that something important has occurred (pizza has arrived), and you can now respond (go get the pizza).

2. Compare EDA with Requestâ€“Response Architecture

| **Feature**                 | **Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)**                    | **Requestâ€“Response Architecture**             |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Communication Style**     | Asynchronous                                           | Synchronous                                   |
| **Coupling Between Services** | Loosely Coupled                                        | Tightly Coupled                               |
| **Scalability**              | Highly Scalable                                        | Limited by synchronous calls                  |
| **Resilience**               | More resilient to failures (via retries, queues)       | Failures propagate to caller                  |
| **Complexity**               | More complex infrastructure                            | Simpler to implement and understand           |
| **Real-Time Processing**     | Supports real-time or near real-time reactions         | Not optimized for real-time scenarios         |

Advantages of EDA:

   - Better for scaling and fault isolation

   - Enables real-time data flow and decoupled services

Advantages of Requestâ€“Response:

   - Easier to develop for simple systems

   - Useful when immediate feedback is required (e.g., form submission)

3. While developing an e-commerce application, how would you use Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) to manage the following scenarios?
    - Placing an order
    - Sending a confirmation email
    - Updating inventory

    a. Placing an Order

    -  When a customer places an order, an OrderPlaced event is published.
    - Other services subscribe to this event and act accordingly.

    b. Sending a Confirmation Email

    - An Email Service listens for the OrderPlaced event and sends a confirmation email to the customer.

    c. Updating Inventory

    - An Inventory Service consumes the OrderPlaced event and reduces the stock for the purchased item.
    - Each of these actions is handled independently, allowing services to work in parallel and scale separately.

4. Why EDA is a Good Fit for Microservices and Cloud-Native Systems

    - Loose Coupling: Services communicate via events and donâ€™t depend on each other directly, allowing independent development, deployment, and scaling.

    - Scalability and Flexibility: EDA naturally supports horizontal scaling. Services can scale based on event volume (e.g., more email processors during sales).

    - Resilience: Events can be retried or delayed without crashing the system, making it fault-tolerant.

5. How EDA Helps Build Scalable Systems (with real-world use cases)

    Benefits for Scalability:

    - Services can scale independently based on demand.
    - Events can be stored, replayed, or queued during spikes.
    - No need to block while waiting for responses.

    ðŸ”„ Use Case 1: Ride-Sharing Apps (e.g., Uber, Lyft)

    Events like RideRequested, DriverAssigned, and RideCompleted are published and handled by different microservices.
    This allows for real-time updates, dynamic pricing, and location tracking â€” all in parallel.

    ðŸ›’ Use Case 2: E-Commerce Order Fulfillment

    OrderPlaced triggers inventory updates, payment processing, and email notifications as separate workflows.
    Each component scales independently during high traffic (e.g., Black Friday).
